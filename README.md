# WakeWord_Recognition
Datasets and .py files you will need to create a convolutional neural network for wakeword recognition

1. Replace the demo files in the "positives" folder with.. say.. 50-100 5-second audio recordings of your desired wakeword 
   (Eg: Alexa, Ok Google, Hey There, Sup Mate etc.)
2. Create a "Negatives" folder with the the same number of audio files containing recordings of other (random) words
   (Eg: Banana. Flights, Hawaii, Steve etc.)
3. Create a "Noise" folder and as the name suggests, store recordings of noise.. just randomly leave your phones in a noisy area

Run the .py files in the same order as in the repository...

Cheers!
